tparty.sh Test Script
---------------------

This bash script will run through some of the non-scons based Native Client
demos, such as Quake, Xaos, Lua, Awk, and some of the bundled examples.

On all platforms, make sure the python http server is running before
launching this script, ie. from the native_client directory:

  python tools/httpd.py

If the server isn't running, the Firefox browser tests will fail.

Many of the tests launched by this script will require user interaction --
the non-browser tests must be manually shutdown to advance to the next test.

Special Note for Windows Users
------------------------------
This script must be run from a Cygwin terminal.  For best results, the
Cygwin DLLs included in Native Client should match the DLLs of your Cygwin
installation.  If you launch tparty.sh with the 'cygfix' argument, it will
copy the required DLLs from the current Cygwin installation and overwrite
the DLLs included with Native Client.
